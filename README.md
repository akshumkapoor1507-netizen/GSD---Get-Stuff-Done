**GSD (Get Stuff Done)**

The Hyper-Local Campus Economy & Productivity Ecosystem

GSD is a comprehensive campus utility platform designed to bridge the gap between student needs and local resources. It creates a self-sustaining micro-economy where students can trade goods, outsource tasks, and manage shared finances—all within a trusted, verified network.

Core Architecture: The Three Pillars
The platform operates on three distinct functional verticals:

1. The Hub (Commerce) 
A peer-to-peer marketplace tailored for immediate campus needs.

Buy/Sell: Trade textbooks, electronics, and dorm essentials.

Rentals: A unique lending system for temporary assets like mini-drafters, lab coats, or scientific calculators.

2. Bounties (Gig Economy) 
A task-based service portal that turns spare time into value.

Post Tasks: Students can outsource errands, technical troubleshooting, or creative gigs.

Earn Rewards: Users complete "bounties" to earn currency and reputation.

3. Squads (Social Finance) 
A collaborative financial tool for student groups.

Money Pots: Seamlessly split bills for cab fares, group meals, or project supplies.

Transparency: Real-time tracking of who owes what, eliminating awkward follow-ups.

The Economic Engine
GSD is gamified to ensure engagement and reliability:

Bones: The internal digital currency that powers transactions within the ecosystem, keeping liquidity within the campus walls.

Trust Score: A dynamic reputation metric that governs user interactions. High trust scores unlock premium features and lending privileges, ensuring accountability.

Generative Core
AI-Native Codebase: The entire architectural logic and codebase were generated using Google AI Studio, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in rapid full-stack prototyping.

Nano Banana Model: Utilized for high-fidelity image generation and dynamic asset creation within the app.

Integrations
Google Maps API: Powers the location-based features for The Hub and Bounties, allowing users to visualize tasks and items available in their immediate vicinity (hostels, labs, library).

Kiro IDE: The primary development environment used to assemble and refine the AI-generated modules.

Expanding Squads to include recurring subscription management.

Integration of local campus event feeds.
